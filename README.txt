===>===>Assignment 1
->Created a nestedlist
->Create a function with an argument
->Used spread operator
->Using while loop iterated the nestedlist;
->Passed data to stack const
->Pop the data to next const
->Ran a condition to check next is array or not
->if 'Yes' then push data to stack from next
->else push the data to res array
->then applyed reverse on res
->then used .filter() method to filter reverse is in not null
->then passed function with the input as argument

===>===>Assignment 2
First "Square of Sum of Natural Numbers"
-->created number to take input as prompt;
->created a variable sum with inital value 0
->using for loop iterated the num1(let i=0;i<=number;i++)
->added all the input integers (sum +=i)
->then mulitipled sum and stored total in other variable(totalSum=sum*sum)
->then printed the total as totalsum.
Second "Sum of Square of Natural Numbers"
->->created number2 to take input as prompt;
->created a variable sum with inital value 0
->using for loop iterated the num1(let j=0;j<=number2;j++)
->Multipled power 2 with all the input integers (sum2 +=i**2)
->then mulitipled sum and stored total in other variable(sum2)
->then printed the total as sum2
-->then printed difference of (totalsum-sum2)
